          <p>
            I am a multifaceted young man. First I started as a Geologist after
            graduating from university. Then after COVID-19 pandemic, I became
            unemployed and And then I learned an activity that I fell in love
            with, PROGRAMMING. When I started gaining skills as a programmer by
            taking online courses, I immediately realized that I had to learn
            English, so I moved to Vancouver to study and gain Canadian work
            experience. Experience as a geologist or as a programmer? Neither
            one nor the other. I learned the art of sheet metal and improved my
            English with my colleagues. Yes ladies and gentlemen, I worked in
            construction, and I don't regret everything I learned there. Now I
            am a freelancer web developer and I will continue learning about
            this wonderful field, without forgetting the science and watching
            what other language I learn while I continue improving my English.
            By the way I also like the guitar XD.
